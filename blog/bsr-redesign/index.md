We're excited to finally launch the new BSR redesign. The BSR has come a long way in the last 2 years and we're thrilled to share the new design with you.

The design was implemented using [connect-web](/blog/connect-web-protobuf-grpc-in-the-browser/index.md) for seamless integration with our API. We've chosen a modern color scheme and improved keyboard accessibility.

## Next steps

We've still got plenty of room to improve the UI and general discoverability of the BSR. The redesign helps position us for those future improvements and we can't wait to share more about those in the coming months.
