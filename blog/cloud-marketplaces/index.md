We're excited to announce that the [Buf Schema Registry](https://buf.build/product/bsr) (BSR) is now available on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-4novs4ul4h3hg) and [Google Cloud Marketplace](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bufbuild-public/buf-schema-registry). Enterprise customers can purchase through the cloud marketplaces and accelerate their deployment of the BSR.

## Cloud marketplaces overview

The AWS and Google Cloud Marketplaces are digital stores that help customers discover, deploy, and manage a wide range of third-party software solutions. Companies are increasingly transacting through the cloud marketplaces for many different reasons, including:

- **Simplified procurement:** Customers can now purchase the Buf Schema Registry directly through their AWS and Google Cloud accounts, eliminating the need for additional vendor approval processes.
- **Access to committed cloud spend:** Purchases through AWS and Google Cloud Marketplaces unlock the ability to better utilize already committed cloud spend.
- **Integrated billing and invoicing:** Marketplaces provide integrated billing and invoicing, allowing customers to manage their Buf Schema Registry subscription alongside their other AWS and Google Cloud services.
