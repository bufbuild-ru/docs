**Today we’re announcing the release of Python support for** [**generated SDKs**](/docs/bsr/generated-sdks/python/index.md) **in the Buf Schema Registry (BSR)!** Python engineers no longer need to manage a Protobuf toolchain or generate code locally—they can now download pre-packaged generated code for their Protobuf schemas from the BSR using package management tools like pip, Poetry, Conda, and others that support [PEP 503 - Simple Repository API](https://peps.python.org/pep-0503/). These packages are automatically made available when schema changes are pushed to the BSR.

**Python package support complements our existing support for generated SDKs in** [**Go**](/docs/bsr/generated-sdks/go/index.md)**,** [**JavaScript/TypeScript**](/docs/bsr/generated-sdks/npm/index.md)**,** [**Java/Kotlin**](/docs/bsr/generated-sdks/maven/index.md)**, and** [**Swift**](/docs/bsr/generated-sdks/swift/index.md)**, enabling clients across many platforms to consume generated packages from Protobuf schemas using their native dependency managers.**

We've updated each BSR module’s Generated SDKs tab with instructions on how to get started with Python generated SDKs using `pip`. You can also find instructions and more details in our [documentation](/docs/bsr/generated-sdks/python/index.md).

## Using generated SDKs with `pip`

Let’s create a small project using `pip` to pull a package from the Buf Python Repository and then use it to interact with the [Connect Demo](https://connectrpc.com/demo/) API.

First, ensure that `python3` is on your `$PATH`. Then, create a new directory for the example:

```protobuf
mkdir buf-python-example
cd buf-python-example
```

Next, create and activate a virtual environment to install your dependencies in:

```protobuf
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

After that, install the dependency while specifying the Buf Python Repository as an extra index:

```protobuf
python3 -m pip install connectrpc-eliza-grpc-python --extra-index-url https://buf.build/gen/python
```

Then, paste the following code into a file called `main.py`:

```protobuf
import grpc

from connectrpc.eliza.v1.eliza_pb2_grpc import ElizaServiceStub
from connectrpc.eliza.v1.eliza_pb2 import SayRequest

def main():
    channel_credentials = grpc.ssl_channel_credentials()
    channel = grpc.secure_channel("demo.connectrpc.com", channel_credentials)
    stub = ElizaServiceStub(channel)

    say_response = stub.Say(SayRequest(sentence="Hello there!"))
    print(say_response.sentence)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

From here, we can execute `main.py` to interact with the Connect Demo API:

```protobuf
$ python3 -m main
Hello...I'm glad you could drop by today.
```

## Type checking

The above example installs just the basics we need to run a Python script, but we’ll also want to be able to use tools like `mypy` or `pyright` to type check the code. For that, we can use type-stub packages that are generated by plugins like [pyi](https://buf.build/protocolbuffers/pyi) and [mypy-protobuf](https://buf.build/community/nipunn1313-mypy).

Let’s install `mypy` first:

```protobuf
$ python3 -m pip install mypy
```

Next, we’ll install our type-stub package:

```javascript
$ python3 -m pip install connectrpc-eliza-protocolbuffers-pyi --extra-index-url https://buf.build/gen/python
```

Now we can type check our script with `mypy`:

```protobuf
$ python3 -m mypy main.py
Output
Success: no issues found in 1 source file
```

## Where to go from here

Head over to our [documentation](/docs/bsr/generated-sdks/python/index.md) to get started with generated SDKs for Python (or any of our other supported languages). As always, we’d love to hear from you—feedback and questions are welcome on the [Buf Slack](https://buf.build/b/slack/)!
