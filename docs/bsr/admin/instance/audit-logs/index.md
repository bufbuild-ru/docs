# Audit logs

::: warning
This feature is only available on the Pro and Enterprise plans.
:::

Your private BSR instance records certain events and actions and allows administrators to query them. This allows administrators to satisfy security, traceability, accountability, policy, and compliance needs, among others.

## Audit events

Each audited event answers the question of _what_ happened, _when_ it happened, _who_ did the action, _which_ resource was affected, and sometimes includes an additional payload and metadata. An audited event looks like this:

```protobuf
message Event {
  // Unique id of the audited event.
  string event_id = 1;
  // Type of the audited event. It specifies "what" happened.
  EventType type = 2;
  // Actor of the audited event. It specifies "who" did it.
  Actor actor = 3;
  // Resource of the audited event. It specifies "which resource" was affected.
  Resource resource = 4;
  // Time of the audited event. It specifies "when" it happened.
  google.protobuf.Timestamp event_time = 5;
  // Metadata about the audited event. It specifies additional details about the audited event.
  EventMetadata metadata = 6;
  oneof payload {
    // ... specific payload details depending on the event type.
  }
}
```

::: tip Note
See the [audit API docs](https://buf.build/bufbuild/buf/docs/e32e91a7a3a14c9db9f7f25989f6d1c8:buf.alpha.audit.v1alpha1#buf.alpha.audit.v1alpha1.Event) for details about the supported payloads.
:::

For both Actors and Resources, each one holds its `Type`, `ID` and `Name`, making the payload of the event sometimes unnecessary.Actor types are either `User` events or `System` events. If the actor is a User, which is true in most scenarios, the metadata include its `User Agent`, `IP` and internal `Trace ID` for further investigation and debugging.`Resource` types can be one of `User`, `Organization`, `Organization Member`, `Repository`, `Repository Contributor`, `Repository Commit`, or `Plugin`.Currently, the BSR audits most events that result in mutations to the data it manages. That includes changes to resources like Users, Organizations, and Repository permissions to name a few. The complete list of audited events, associated payloads, and their respective type specifications can be found in the [BSR's schema documentation](https://buf.build/bufbuild/buf/docs/e32e91a7a3a14c9db9f7f25989f6d1c8:buf.alpha.audit.v1alpha1#buf.alpha.audit.v1alpha1.EventType). Treat it as a living document, since it grows to keep pace with new BSR features as they're released.For more in-depth descriptions of each event type, see the [event details section](#audit-event-details).

## Querying audit events

An [administrator](../user-lifecycle/#admin-users) can access the BSR's audit logs by using the [`ListAuditedEvents` RPC](https://buf.build/bufbuild/buf/docs/e32e91a7a3a14c9db9f7f25989f6d1c8:buf.alpha.audit.v1alpha1#buf.alpha.audit.v1alpha1.AuditService.ListAuditedEvents). This endpoint currently supports filtering events by time period and result pagination.![Listing Audit Events using Buf Studio](../../../../images/bsr/list-audit-events.png)

## Audit event details

### User events

These events have a `User` as an affected resource.

<div class="joplin-table-wrapper"><table><tbody><tr><th>Event</th><th>Details</th></tr><tr><td>User Created</td><td>User creates an account in the BSR server.</td></tr><tr><td>User Deactivated</td><td>BSR admin accounts are able to deactivate Usersâ€™ accounts. In that scenario, an <code>UserDeactivated</code> event is logged.</td></tr><tr><td>User Deleted</td><td>Depending on the BSR instance configuration, Users might be able to self-delete their accounts. BSR administrators can also force-delete BSR users. In both scenarios, the user deletion event is logged.</td></tr><tr><td>User Logged In</td><td>BSR logs a <code>UserLoggedIn</code> event in three scenarios:<ol><li>User authenticated/logged in via SAML (their account is auto provisioned in the system).</li><li>User logged in via SSO (OAuth/OIDC) and already had a registered account.</li><li>User logged in via SSO (OAuth/OIDC) and then registers an account (we only log the event if the user follows through with the account registration).</li></ol></td></tr><tr><td>User Logged Out</td><td>User manually logs out of the server.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>

### Organization events

These events have either an `Organization` or an `Organization Member` as an affected resource. BSR Organizations can have multiple members, with different access roles.
