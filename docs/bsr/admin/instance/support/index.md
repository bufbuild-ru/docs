# Pro and Enterprise support

We're here to help you with any questions you may have about your private BSR instance. We offer the following support options:

- Contact [Support](https://support.buf.build) or your Buf representative.
- **Enterprise plan only:** A shared Slack channel. Reach out to your Buf representative to set this up.

You can find the Buf status page at [bufstatus.com](https://www.bufstatus.com)

## Incidents

We carefully monitor each private BSR instance to meet SLAs. In the rare event that you're experiencing a critical issue and haven't received any communications from us yet, our on-call engineers are available at oncall@buf.build and will investigate any reported issues.
