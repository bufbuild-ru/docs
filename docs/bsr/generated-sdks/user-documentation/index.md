# User documentation

Generated SDKs provide setup and install documentation for themselves. They also generate their own [API reference documentation](../tutorial/#api-reference) for Go and TypeScript.In addition, the BSR allows anyone with the correct permissions to add a "Getting started" guide to an SDK page to help end users integrate further. The guide is an open-text Markdown editor and can be edited inline. Access to the editor is limited to BSR instance admins and anyone with the [`Owner` or `Admin` role](../../admin/manage-members/#member-roles) in the organization that owns the repository the SDK is generated from.

## Adding a guide

If no user documentation exists for the SDK, the end user doesn't see the editor, but anyone with access can see it and click into it to begin a guide:![Screenshot of the editor's beginning state](../../../images/bsr/sdks/gs-editor-empty.png)Once you click the **Open the markdown editor** button, the editor opens with an empty editor on the left and a preview on the right. Start typing or paste in your text and the preview adjusts:![Screenshot of the editor's active window](../../../images/bsr/sdks/gs-editor-preview.png)If you're writing in the editor, you can either input Markdown directly or use the WYSIWYG buttons to format your text and add images and tables. Image URLs must be publicly addressableâ€”the editor doesn't allow you to upload images.When you're done editing the text, click **Publish** and the editor closes. The guide is immediately visible to anyone who goes to that SDK page:![Screenshot of the published guide](../../../images/bsr/sdks/gs-editor-published.png)

## Editing or deleting a guide

You can edit the guide at any time by clicking **Edit**. Make your changes and click **Publish** to publish the revision.To remove the guide, click the trash can icon at the top right of the editor.

WarningThe SDK getting started guide isn't a version-controlled resource. When its content is changed, older versions can't be recovered.
