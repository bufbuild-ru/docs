# buf.lock v1 config file

::: tip Note
This file now has a `v2` configuration available. See the [v2 `buf.lock` reference](../../v2/buf-lock/) and the [v1 to v2 migration guide](../../../migration-guides/migrate-v2-config-files/) for details about the new configuration and migration instructions.
:::

If your [`buf.yaml`](../buf-yaml/) declares any `deps`, it should be accompanied by a `buf.lock` file that contains your [module](../../../cli/modules-workspaces/)'s dependency manifest. This manifest represents a single, reproducible build of your module.

You can create or update a `buf.lock` file for your module by running the `buf dep update` command. For example, given this directory layout and `buf.lock` content for the `buf.build/acme/petapis` module:

```text
.
├── acme
│   └── pet
│       └── v1
│           └── pet.proto
├── buf.lock
└── buf.yaml
```

::: info buf.lock

```yaml
# Generated by buf. DO NOT EDIT.
version: v1
deps:
  - remote: buf.build
    owner: acme
    repository: paymentapis
    commit: 9a877cf260e1488d869a31fce3bea26d
    digest: b4:4af5b88c9a1d9b36421ad84a2cff211fc74995040188dafc1c8508d36406140e40eb0ab82d21e761961e4a71631d4474e3d0608b987ca3d02d5d19012edff21d
```

:::

::: warning Warning
As the file itself notes, `buf.lock` should never be hand-edited, as it's the result of actually resolving the dependencies.
:::

### `deps`

Each entry in the `buf.lock` `deps` key is a module pin, which uniquely represents a specific snapshot of the given module (`buf.build/acme/paymentapis:9a877cf260e1488d869a31fce3bea26d` in this case), protected with a cryptographic digest of all of the files in it (see how we [protect dependencies against tampering](../../../bsr/module/dependency-management/#tamper-proofing)). With this, the local snapshot of the `buf.build/acme/petapis` module and all of its dependencies are uniquely represented, reproducible, and protected against tampering.
