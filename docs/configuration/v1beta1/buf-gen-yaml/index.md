# buf.gen.yaml v1beta1 configuration

The `buf.gen.yaml` file is largely unchanged between `v1beta1` and `v1`, so refer to the `v1` [`buf.gen.yaml`](../../v1/buf-gen-yaml/) documentation. If you were an early adopter of [managed mode](../../../generate/managed-mode/) in `v1beta1`, we strongly recommend upgrading to `v2` configuration files. See the [migration guide](../../../migration-guides/migrate-v2-config-files/) for instructions and context for managed mode changes.
