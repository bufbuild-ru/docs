# buf curl overview

The `buf curl` command lets you invoke RPCs on a Connect, gRPC, or gRPC-Web server. This improves usability over the standard [curl](https://curl.se/) utility since `buf curl` handles aspects of the relevant protocol for you, without you having to define the right headers and craft message envelopes. It also allows you to provide request data and view response data in JSON format, even while the on-the-wire format is binary.

```console
$ buf curl \
    --data '{"sentence": "I feel happy."}' \
    https://demo.connectrpc.com/connectrpc.eliza.v1.ElizaService/Say

 {"sentence":"Do you often feel happy?"}
```

You can view a listing of all supported options and how to use them by running `buf help curl`.

## RPC Target

The only positional argument is the URL of the RPC method to invoke. The name of the method to invoke comes from the last two path components of the URL, which should be the fully qualified service name and method name, respectively.

```console
$ buf curl \
    https://demo.connectrpc.com/connectrpc.eliza.v1.ElizaService/Say
```

The URL can use either `http` or `https` as the scheme. If `http` is used then the HTTP 1.1 protocol is used unless the `--http2-prior-knowledge` flag is set. If `https` is used then HTTP/2 is preferred during protocol negotiation and HTTP 1.1 used only if the server doesn't support HTTP/2.The default RPC protocol used is [Connect](https://connectrpc.com/docs/protocol). To use a different protocol, [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md) or [gRPC-Web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-WEB.md), use the `--protocol` flag.

::: info Using gRPC without TLS

```console
$ buf curl --protocol grpc --http2-prior-knowledge \
    http://localhost:20202/foo.bar.v1.FooService/DoSomething
```

:::

::: tip The gRPC protocol can't be used with HTTP 1.1, but the other two can as long as the method being invoked isn't a bidirectional streaming method.

:::

## Request Data

The input request is specified via the `-d` or `--data` flag. If absent, an empty request is sent unless the method uses a request stream, in which case an empty stream is sent.There are two ways to provide the request body:

1.  _Immediate_: The value of the `--data` flag is the request body.
2.  _File_: The value of the `--data` flag starts with an at-sign (`@`). The rest of the flag value is interpreted as a filename from which to read the request body. If that filename is just a dash (`-`) then the request body is read from _stdin_.

The request body is a JSON document that contains the JSON formatted request message. If the RPC method being invoked is a client-streaming method, the request body may consist of multiple JSON values, appended to one another. Multiple JSON documents should usually be separated by whitespace, though this isn't strictly required unless the request message type has a custom JSON representation that isn't a JSON object.If the `--data` flag is specified multiple times, only the value of the last occurrence is used.

## Request Metadata

Request metadata (such as headers) are defined using `-H` or `--header` flags. The flag value is in `name: value` format.There are two ways to provide the request metadata:

1.  _Immediate_: The flag value is in `name: value` format and defines a single header to add to the request.
2.  _File_: The value of the `--header` flag starts with an at-sign (`@`). The rest of the flag value is interpreted as a filename from which to read request headers, each header on a separate line. If that filename is just a dash (`-`) then the request headers are read from _stdin_.

If headers and the request body are both to be read from the same file (or both read from _stdin_), the file must include headers first, then a blank line, and then the request body:

::: info Example file with both metadata and data

```text
Custom-Header-1: foo-bar-baz
Authorization: token jas8374hgnkvje9wpkerebncjqol4

{
   "sentence": "Hi, doc. I feel hungry."
}
```

:::

The `--header` flag may be specified multiple times. The headers sent with the request are the union of all values provided.

## RPC Schema

Transcoding from the binary Protobuf format to JSON requires access to the schema for the messages in question. By default, `buf curl` expects the server to expose the [server](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/proto/grpc/reflection/v1/reflection.proto) [reflection](https://github.com/connectrpc/grpcreflect-go) [service](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/server-reflection.md#known-implementations).If the server doesn't support reflection, you can instead indicate the schema to use via a `--schema` option. This option accepts the same kind of [inputs](../../reference/inputs/) as `buf build` and `buf generate`, letting you point to Protobuf sources on disk, in a Git repo, or in a [BSR](../../bsr/) module.

```console
$ buf curl \
    --schema buf.build/connectrpc/eliza \
    --data '{"name": "Bob Loblaw"}' \
    https://demo.connectrpc.com/connectrpc.eliza.v1.ElizaService/Introduce
```

### Server Reflection

By default, `buf curl` tries the latest and most appropriate server reflection protocol and then falls back to other protocols if necessary. As of this writing, there are two protocols supported:

1.  **grpc-v1**: This corresponds to version "v1" of the gRPC server reflection service ([source](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/proto/grpc/reflection/v1/reflection.proto)). This is the preferred version and is attempted first.
2.  **grpc-v1alpha**: This corresponds to version "v1alpha" of the same reflection service ([source](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/proto/grpc/reflection/v1alpha/reflection.proto)). Many gRPC servers only support this older version.

If you know the server only supports v1alpha, you can use `--reflect-protocol=grpc-v1alpha` to have `buf curl` use that instead of first trying v1.You can separately configure headers used for reflection requests using `--reflect-header` flags. If you want `buf curl` to send all of the same headers as for the main RPC invocation, you can use `--reflect-header=*`.If server reflection is used, the assumed URL for the reflection service is the same as the given RPC target URL, but with the last two path elements removed and replaced with the service and method name for the server reflection protocol.

::: tip Server reflection doesn't currently work with HTTP 1.1 since the supported reflection protocols rely on bidirectional streaming.

:::

## Output

By default, `buf curl` prints the response messages to _stdout_ in JSON format. If an RPC error occurs, the error information is printed to _stderr_, also in JSON format, and the exit code is the [gRPC error code](https://grpc.github.io/grpc/core/md_doc_statuscodes.html) shifted three bits to the left. A non-zero exit code that's less than eight indicates incorrect usage or other unexpected error.You can enable verbose output via the `-v` or `--verbose` flag. This generates a lot of output to _stderr_ which may be helpful for troubleshooting, including details related to TLS and traces of all RPC activity, including server reflection calls.

## Examples

Issue a unary RPC to a plain-text (like "h2c") gRPC server, where the schema for the service is in a Buf module in the current directory, using an empty request message:

```console
$ buf curl --schema . --protocol grpc --http2-prior-knowledge \
    http://localhost:20202/foo.bar.v1.FooService/DoSomething
```

Issue an RPC to a Connect server, where the schema comes from the Buf Schema Registry, using a request that's defined as a command-line argument:

```console
$ buf curl \
    --schema buf.build/connectrpc/eliza \
    --data '{"name": "Bob Loblaw"}' \
    https://demo.connectrpc.com/connectrpc.eliza.v1.ElizaService/Introduce

{"sentence":"Hi Bob Loblaw. I'm Eliza."}
{"sentence":"Before we begin, Bob Loblaw, let me tell you something about myself."}
{"sentence":"I was created by Joseph Weizenbaum."}
{"sentence":"How are you feeling today?"}
```

Issue a unary RPC to a server that supports reflection, with verbose output:

```console
$ buf curl -v \
   --data '{"sentence": "I am not feeling well."}' \

Issue a client-streaming RPC to a gRPC-web server that supports reflection, where custom headers and request data are both in a _heredoc_:

```console
$ buf curl --data @- --header @- --protocol grpcweb \
    https://demo.connectrpc.com/connectrpc.eliza.v1.ElizaService/Converse \
    <<EOM
Custom-Header-1: foo-bar-baz
Authorization: token jas8374hgnkvje9wpkerebncjqol4

{"sentence": "Hi, doc. I feel hungry."}
{"sentence": "What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?"}
{"sentence": "If you were a fish, what kind of fish would you be?."}
EOM

{"sentence":"When you feel hungry, what do you do?"}
{"sentence":"How would an answer to that help you?"}
{"sentence":"Why do you say that about me?"}
```
